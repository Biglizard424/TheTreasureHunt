# The Treasure Hunt

Aye aye, ye scallywags, gather close and take a glance,

For The Treasure Hunt be startin’, a pirate’s daring chance.

No map nor mate will steer yer way, no parrot squawks the clue,

Ye’ll face each trial, solve each test, and see what ye can do.


Each riddle be a crashing wave, each task the roaring sea,

To prove yer wit, yer grit, yer nerve, yer pirate destiny.

So hoist yer flag and set yer course before the daylight fades,

For only the bold and sharp of mind will claim the prize that waits.
